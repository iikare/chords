# chords
A collection of interesting chord progressions I've noticed over time. 

This is just a supplement to my own compositional findings, but do feel free to contribute with chord progressions
you find interesting. 

This is also an experiment to render sheet music with LaTeX, which turns out to be more difficult than expected...
